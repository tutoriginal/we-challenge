Testers for weekend challenge 00
--------------------------------

To test a project's functionality:
	-put the .c in a folder
	-python test_rendu.py foldername [studentlogin]

To test a project's execution time:
	-put the .c in a folder
	-python speed_rendu.py foldername [studentlogin]

Correction guidelines:
	-Test the functionality of each student's work with test_rendu.py
	-python speed_rendy.py foldername studentlogin >> result.txt
	-Compare score in result.txt, lowest score is the fastest strlen and highest score the slowest
	-Read all source codes to find the most creative one
	
TODO : 
	-ADD MORE TESTS, the more test we have the more precise the speed_tester will be !
